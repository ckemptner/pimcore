# Assets

In Pimcore, multimedia content such as image files and videos, as well as document files (Word files, Excel spreadsheets, PDF), are stored an managed 
in the "Assets" area. Thus they are made available for output-channels such as a website for viewing or downloading.
Pimcore offers different features depending on the asset type. The standard features include previewing and adding metadata to assets.
Additional features are available for the most common asset type - images. These can be edited directly in Pimcore and have pre-defined metadata available. 
For images and videos thumbnails for different output channels can be automatically created with the Image Transformation Pipeline. Therefore, you only have 
to store a single high resolution file of an image or video and the various output formats you need will be rendered by Pimcore automatically in the background.
